# PyCode
Collection of my Python Code that I wrote.

## WebScraper
The first piece of code is a webscraper that was written in order to scrape articles & their respective links from the DaarusSunnah website.
The code utilises the BeautifulSoup & Requests library to scrape the data from site from each page where an article is available. Then the OpenPyXL library is used to output the data scraped to an Excel spreadsheet of 2 coloumns labelled Articles & Links respectively.
